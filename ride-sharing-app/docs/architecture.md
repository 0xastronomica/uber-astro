# Architecture of the Ride-Sharing Application

## Overview

The ride-sharing application is designed to connect riders with drivers through a seamless and efficient platform. The architecture is built on microservices, allowing for scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment of services.

## Components

### 1. API Gateway

The API Gateway acts as the single entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservices and handles cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, and rate limiting.

### 2. Microservices

The application consists of several microservices, each responsible for a specific domain:

- **Auth Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization, including registration, login, and token management.
  
- **Rider Service**: Handles rider-related functionalities, such as ride requests, ride history, and user profiles.
  
- **Driver Service**: Manages driver-related functionalities, including driver registration, ride acceptance, and driver profiles.
  
- **Matching Service**: Implements algorithms to match riders with available drivers based on location and other criteria.
  
- **Billing Service**: Manages payment processing, fare calculations, and transaction history.
  
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users regarding ride status, promotions, and other relevant updates.

### 3. Frontend Applications

The application includes both web and mobile clients:

- **Web Client**: A React-based web application for riders and drivers to interact with the platform.
  
- **Mobile Client**: A React Native application providing a native experience for users on mobile devices.

## Infrastructure

The application is deployed using Kubernetes for orchestration and Docker for containerization. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform, allowing for reproducible and scalable deployments.

### 1. Kubernetes

Kubernetes is used to manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of the microservices. The architecture includes:

- **Base Configurations**: Common settings and resources shared across environments.
  
- **Overlay Configurations**: Environment-specific settings for development, staging, and production.

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline

A continuous integration and deployment pipeline is set up to automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring that new features and fixes are delivered quickly and reliably.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust foundation for the ride-sharing application, enabling efficient communication between services, scalability to handle varying loads, and a user-friendly experience across platforms.
